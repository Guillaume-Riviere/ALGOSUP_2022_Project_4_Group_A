# 1. Introduction

The goal of the project is to provide a way to visit the school as if we were in.
It will be visitable using **Virtual Reality** headset.

It should be able to anticipate issues that could append in the school and also a way to visit the school without being physically in it.

All logic systems should also be applied to the virtual environment. By logic systems, we mainly means doors locked to unauthorized peoples.

Some scenarios should be possible to simulate in order to see what append in the school

It's also a realistic simulation, it's not a video game.
Physics have to be applied to objets, rooms, user.
By physics we means no flight across walls, no permissions bypass not planned.

# 2. What's VR ? Why VR ?

**VR** stands for **Virtual Reality**
VR is a simulated world that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. In that case, closest to reality, better it will be.
VR is simulated using a Headset that the user have to wear to visit the simulation

Since we want a realistic simulation, VR is the closest to the reality.
It allows a user to simulate the school as if he was inside.
VR could have been avoided but the immersion wouldn't have been as intense.

Some person will be user of school, some can be visitors, on even stranger.

### c. Teleportation to short distance

It's a person you can't control, it's usually here to help you.
